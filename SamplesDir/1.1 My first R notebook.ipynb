Each cell can be \"runned\" or \"executed\" individually.\n\nFor code cells the output of the code will be shown once the cell has been runned. In each code cell you can use whatever have been generated by code cells that have previously been run. However, it is a good idea to have code cell only depend on cells above it, so when you clear and run all cells you will not run into problems.\n\nJyputer is just a special kind of notebooks. Jyputer notebooks supports many different programming languages such as Julia, Python and R. We will only use it with R. (The documentation for Jupyter can be found here: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n\n### What is Azure notebooks then?\n\nA Jupyter notebook need to be executed somewhere - the code need to run somewhere. You can install Jupyter locally on your machine and execute Jupyter notebooks. Alternatively you can use Microsofts Azure Notebooks to run you Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. This is the recommended option for this course as you don't have to install an software and be concerned with what version of R you are using."
